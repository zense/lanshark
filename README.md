 |                           Note                          |
 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 | This is an old piece of software. I wrote it over six   |
 | years ago. Use it at your own risk. ;)                  |
 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 |                       Installation                      |
 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 | See INSTALL                                             |
 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 |                      Web Interface                      |
 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 | The webinterface is normally located at port 31337.     |
 | Try entering localhost:31337 into the address bar after |
 | starting the Daemon. You can also find a link to the    |
 | webinterface in the menu of the gui. Its located under  |
 | lanshark/webinterface. Please notice that the gui       |
 | only tries to guess your public ip address.             |
 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 |                      Configuration                      |
 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 | The GUI automatically shows a grafical configuration    |
 | interface on the first start. If you are using the      |
 | command line you have to configure lanshark manually    |
 | before using it. You need to change at least two keys   |
 |  - SHARE_PATH                                           |
 |  - INCOMING_PATH                                        |
 | I recommend to create a folder called incoming inside   |
 | the share path fpr the INCOMING_PATH so everything      |
 | you download with lanshark gets shared again.           |
 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 |                       Config File                       |
 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 | For linux config file is located in                     |
 | $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lanshark/config. Which points normally |
 | to ~/.config/lanshark/config                            |
 |                                                         |
 | If you've used the windows installer the config file    |
 | will be located in your home directory and called       |
 | lanshark.conf                                           |
 |                                                         |
 | For the portable windows version the config file        |
 | is located in the conf folder and called lanshark.conf  |
 |                                                         |
 | The config file is pretty self descriptive.             |
 | Just look at the comments (the lines starting           |
 | with a #).                                              |
 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 |          Cover Artwork/Custom Icons for Folders         |
 +---------------------------------------------------------+
 | To define a cover/custom icon for a folder call the     |
 | file folder.png, folder.jpg, cover.jpg etc.             |
 | You can customize the list of regular expressions       |
 | used to match the icons in the config file.             |
 | The config key is called FolderImages.                  |
 +---------------------------------------------------------+
